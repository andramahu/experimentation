# experimentation
There will be two phases.
1. Training phase
This will display images one after the other in order for the subject to memorize these images. They will not be presented for too long (duraction of about 2 seconds)
No response is asked for from the subject.


2. Testing phase (recall task)
The subject will be presented with the images shown before as well as some images not seen before, in a randomized pattern. The task is to display images and request a response 
from the participant (Yes: it was in the series before, or No: It was not)
